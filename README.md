# Video Poker

## Project description

My little poker "game".

[Demo on github.io](https://robotsson.github.io/poker/)

Developed in JavaScript.

Cards by The wild kin @ itch.io.

Using hand detection algorithm described in natural language on ["Nick's blog"](https://nsayer.blogspot.com/2007/07/algorithm-for-evaluating-poker-hands.html).


### TODO

- Make it a real game with betting, folding, discard, etc. I think I should make it a React project before moving on to that.

- Sound effects for winning hands, game page load, game start.
