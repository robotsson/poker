# Video Poker

## Project description

My little poker game. A prototype, the code is a bit messy.

[Demo on github.io](https://robotsson.github.io/poker/)

Developed in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Cards by The wild kin @ itch.io.

Using hand detection algorithm described in natural language on ["Nick's blog"](https://nsayer.blogspot.com/2007/07/algorithm-for-evaluating-poker-hands.html).


### TODO

- Sound effects for winning hands, game page load, game start.
- Code cleanup & structuring
- Cleaner restart of a run
- No folds, can still press deal
- Betting logic
