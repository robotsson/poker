### Video Poker

My little poker "game".

Coded in JavaScript in the style of old-school C for my own amusement.

Cards by The wild kin @ itch.io.

Using hand detection algorithm described in natural language on ["Nick's blog"](https://nsayer.blogspot.com/2007/07/algorithm-for-evaluating-poker-hands.html).


### TODO

Make it a real game with betting, folding, etc. I think I should make it a React project before moving on to that.
